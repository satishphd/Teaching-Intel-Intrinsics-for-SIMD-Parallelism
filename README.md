# Teaching-Intel-Intrinsics-for-SIMD-Parallelism
Teaching Vectorization and SIMD using Intel Intrinsics in a Computer Organization and Architecture class 

Intel Intrinsics Guide for Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX): https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#techs=AVX

My youtube lecture link on this topic of using SIMD parallelism using Intrinsics (1 hour lecture): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KABGmD7BJ28

1) arrayLab.c is a program that can be assigned as lab work or homework for writing C loops using intrinsics

2) evalPoly.c is a program that contains a function to evaluate a polynomial. Lab work can be using intrinsics to implement the function.

3) matmul_intrinsic.c is a program that contains program that uses Intel AVX functions to implement matrix-matrix multiplication.

4) A pdf of the presentation slide is also there.

5) Problems for Quiz/Exam
